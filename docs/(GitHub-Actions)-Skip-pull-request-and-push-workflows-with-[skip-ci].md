GitHub Actions supports skipping `push` and `pull_request` workflows. 👏 

>If any commit message in your push or the HEAD commit of your PR contains the strings `[skip ci]`, `[ci skip]`, `[no ci]`, `[skip actions]`, or `[actions skip]` workflows triggered on the `push` or `pull_request` events will be skipped.
